<p>My advising philosophy is very simple. <em>I 120% trust you, and I see us as a team working together to add some value to the world through our technical skills.</em> And that means we must take full responsibility for the quality and integrity of our work.</p>

<p>To do meaningful research, we need to stay informed about developments in both industry and academia. This requires actively reading and engaging with papers, not just passively consuming them. Our experiments must be rigorous and reproducible. The ideas and proposals we present should be articulated clearly so that others can understand, evaluate, and build upon them.</p>

<p><em>I do not consider you a student working under me. I consider you a colleague working with me.</em> That makes communication absolutely essential. If you do not share updates, collaboration becomes impossible. Do not hide issues or assume that issues can be ignored or worked around quietly. That is not professional behavior; that is not <em>responsible</em>.</p>

<p>Be clear about what needs discussion, and bring it to me or to the team. We overcome challenges together with hard work. That is how we create value and how our work stands apart from the countless superficial projects floating around on the web.</p>

<h1 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Engage with State-of-the-Art Research
    <ul>
      <li>Develop the ability to read and critically analyze latest papers</li>
      <li>Understand that research papers may not be organized like textbooks and require active interpretation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Problem Identification and Formulation:
    <ul>
      <li>Learn how to identify meaningful technical problems - Formulate them in a way that allows for empirical evaluation and theoretical analysis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Experimental Rigor
    <ul>
      <li>Design and conduct experiments that are methodologically sound and capable of objectively validating technical hypotheses or system designs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Professional Communication:
    <ul>
      <li>Communicate ideas clearly and professionally, both in writing and oral discussions</li>
      <li>Communicate the research progress regularly and ask for helps</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Work Planning and Execution:
    <ul>
      <li>Develop realistic and executable research plans, especially with regard to implementation and experimentation timelines</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="expectations">Expectations</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Be proactive and take ownership of your research.</li>
  <li>Come prepared to meetings with updates and specific questions or discussion points.</li>
  <li>Seek feedback actively and revise your work based on constructive critique.</li>
  <li>Maintain integrity and transparency in all research activities, including data collection, implementation, and authorship.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="cs-297-deliverables">CS 297 Deliverables</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Share regular progress updates at weekly meetings. Participation to weekly in-person research meetings is mandatory.
    <ul>
      <li>Write down a few bullet points summarizing what you did in the last week and what you will do in the coming week, for every meeting</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>At the end of the semester, submit a research paper (~ 5 pages in IEEE format) that includes:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Introduction</strong> motivating the project topic and clearly defining the research objectives</li>
      <li><strong>Related works</strong> summarizing 10-20 relevant research papers and contrasting them with the project</li>
      <li><strong>Problem formulation</strong> defining the research problem in a way that can be qualitatively evaluated</li>
      <li><strong>Method</strong> summarizing the proposed methods</li>
      <li><strong>Preliminary results</strong> summarizing the initial sets of experiment results and their implications</li>
      <li><strong>Future works</strong> suggesting the directions for CS 298</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="continuation-to-cs-298">Continuation to CS 298</h1>
<p>Think of it this way: if you were your own colleague, would you want to work with yourself?</p>

<p>If I consistently see poor communication or no meaningful progress (especially no preliminary implementation or results), I won’t be able to supervise you for CS 298. That means you’ll need to redo CS 297 with another faculty member.</p>
